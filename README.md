# Minimum-spanning-tree
Minimum spanning tree codes. 
Codes of Prim, Boruvka and Kruskal.
They found the minimum spanning tree in a graph.

# Prim
Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that is used to find the minimum spanning tree from a graph. Prim's algorithm finds the subset of edges that includes every vertex of the graph such that the sum of the weights of the edges can be minimized.

Prim's algorithm starts with the single node and explores all the adjacent nodes with all the connecting edges at every step. The edges with the minimal weights causing no cycles in the graph got selected.

# Boruvka
Boruvka's algorithm is straightforward and intuitive. It is a greedy algorithm that constructs a globally "optimal" solution using smaller, locally optimal solutions for smaller sub problems.

Greedy algorithms are generally concerned with the most optimal solution when the smaller steps add up.
